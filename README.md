# Protein-Design

### Description

This repo gives you the workflow for designing new alpha-amylase variants with improved activity.
We use the structure of alpha-amylase from PDB iD [1BAG](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1BAG) and 
use [ESM3](https://github.com/evolutionaryscale/esm) to generate candidate designs for further evaluation.
We also build an ML model to predict alpha-amylase activity from the amino acid sequences to score our designs.

The overall workflow is as below
